# ML Project: Evaluating Algorithms for Electric Car Eligibility

## Introduction

This was my first college project, where focused on exploring various machine learning algorithms to determine their effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The dataset chosen for this project pertains to the eligibility of electric cars for the Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle tax credit in the State of Washington for the year 2020.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different machine learning models on tabular data on binary classification task.


## Dataset

The original dataset can be found on the State of Washington's open data portal or directly accessed via [this Link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data/resource/fa51be35-691f-45d2-9f3e-535877965e69).
